                    <p>Hi, I'm Caleb! I'm a PhD student at New York University. My academic research spans from technical AI research to understanding the broader societal implications of the AI revolution, particularly its impact on the economy and labor markets.</p>
                    <div class="paragraph-spacer"></div>
                    <p>Recently, I've been exploring how AI can amplify human capabilities in advocacy settings. My current focus is on developing interactive systems that help people practice and improve their communication about complex ethical issues, with a particular interest in animal welfare advocacy.</p>

                    <h3>Strategic Wealth Accumulation Under Transformative AI Expectations</h3>
                    <p class="paper-description">The rapid progress of development in the field of artificial intelligence may profoundly reshape the global economy by both increasing productivity and automating away many jobs. This paper explores how households adjust their economic behavior today in anticipation of transformative AI (TAI). Building on previous research, I introduce a novel mechanism where the future reallocation of labor from humans to AI systems owned by wealthy households creates a zero-sum contest for control over AI resources—driving changes in current savings decisions and asset prices.</p>

                    <p class="paper-description">NSCAN is a novel deep learning model for predicting multiple stock returns simultaneously using financial news data and
                    cross-attention mechanisms. Unlike traditional approaches that predict returns for individual stocks in isolation, our
                    model captures cross-asset relationships and market interactions.</p>

                    <p class="paper-description">States match federal SBIR grants to incentivize local R&D, but do they work? Looking at Kentucky's aggressive state match program using synthetic control methods, I find mixed results, including a large yet statistically insignificant increase in private R&D, and a surprising negative effect on new business formation.</p>

                    <p class="paper-description">Previous research shows religious people are happier, but correlation isn't causation.

Unlike standard bargaining theory which predicts costly conflicts should never occur, prospect theory shows that when parties have conflicting reference points, fighting can become unavoidable.</p>
